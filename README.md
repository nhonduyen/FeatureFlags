What are Feature Flags?
Feature Flags are a software development technique that allows us to essentially wrap our application features in a conditional statement, providing a toggle to enable or disable the feature. Most importantly, we can toggle features during runtime, meaning that we do not need to redeploy our application to enable a new feature or disable an old or broken feature.
